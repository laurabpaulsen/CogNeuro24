# EEG LAB DAY 1

## Plan for today

### 1. Create virtual environment
The first step today is to create a virtual environment. Follow the instruction in the [README.md](../README.md#setting-up-virtual-environment) file one step up in the EEG folder.

### 2. (Optional) Python brush-up
I have created a notebook with a few exercises to brush up on your Python skills. I have included things that I found especially relevant in terms of understanding the syntax used when working with EEG data using the `MNE-python` package. Additionally there is an introduction to working with 3-dimensional arrays in Numpy. I recommend you scroll through the notebook and determine whether you need to do the exercises or not. 

The notebook is called [Python_brush_up.ipynb](Python_brush_up.ipynb) and is located in the this folder.

### 3. Preprocessing (and some visualisation) of EEG data
The remainder of today should be spend going through the [EEG_preprocessing.ipynb](EEG_preprocessing.ipynb) notebook. This notebook will guide you through the steps of loading EEG data, preprocessing it, and creating some visualisations of the data. I recommend you sit in small groups and talk through the exercises as you go along. 

Remember to ask questions if you get stuck or if you are unsure about something, either code or theory related. Additionally MNE has a very good [documentation](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) that you can use to look up functions and methods. Getting familiar with the documentation is a good idea, as it is a big help if you choose to work with EEG data for your exam project.
