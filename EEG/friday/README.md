## Analysis of your own EEG data


This directory holds three notebooks that can serve as inspiration when analysing your own data. The notebooks are:

**windowed_mean.ipynb:** This notebook shows the most simple analysis. It introduces the concept of a windowed mean, where two conditions are compared by taking the mean of the signal in a certain time window in relevant sensors and comparing the means. This includes some basic plotting and statistical testing using the t-test.

**clusterbased_permutation.ipynb:** This notebook shows how to do a cluster-based permutation test. 

**decoding.ipynb:** This notebook shows how to do a simple decoding analysis using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA).



## Data
I have preprocessed some data and made it available to you on uCloud for the purpose of demonstatring the three types of analysis. It consists of FaceWord data from last years EEG course from 3 participants.
